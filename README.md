# ECM-1410-Object-oriented-Programming
Simularly to ECM-1400, this was split up into three different controlled assessments. 
CA1 was a structured problem, with all the classes of the system and their respective attributes already specified. This project was to make a simple database system for a univeristy and then answer some questions about object-oriented programming.  
CA2 was much less structured, they gave a problem, expected behaviour of the system, and I had to solve it. This project was to create a covid test booking system. 
CA3 was pair programming. They gave the problem in a similar format but I had to work with a partner. This project was to create a social media application.
